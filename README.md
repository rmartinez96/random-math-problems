# Random Math Problems 

Done in Python 3.

When I get bored, I find simple math problems I think are interesting and make them into functions in python.

### Math Problems 
1. Factorial
2. Sequence Sum
3. Fibonnaci Sequence
4. Pascal's Triangle

More to come!

### Files
**driver.py** runs the code.

**func.py** has the math functions.
